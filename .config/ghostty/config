# My experience making Ghostty, Tmux, and sending Kitty key codes work together:
# - By default, tmux can see C-S-h/j/k/l. If I explicitly make Tmux forward the Kitty key codes,
# - it will do so
# - By default, tmux can recognize and forward C-<bs> and M-<bs>. It does not properly recognize
# - and forward C-S-<bs>
# - Turning on extended keys does not help
# - Setting xterm-ghostty:extkeys does allow C-S-<bs> to be recognized
# - However, as I understand, because ghostty is now aware of Tmux, it will avoid sending certain
# - key codes it knows that by default Tmux doesn't know what to do with
# - Because my Tmux config is mapped to explicitly pass these keys through, they are also
# - explicitly mapped here
